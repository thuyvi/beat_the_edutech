my edutech journey

<h1 style="font-size:20px;"><b> This path is TOUGH! </b></h1>

I am here, alone in Canada, pursuing a Master degree in Education, and trying to persuade people to hire me as an education technologist...
It's a pain-in-the-ass process.

Last week, I had to visit and moan with a Graduate School counsellor that I was so depressed and lost, and that I was thinking about leaving everything to go back to Vietnam.
We had a long talk. Now, I am writing to encourage myself as a process of therapy.<br> 
It is a cycle of depression. 

I know that I should keep moving on, believing the journey to define myself. 

I just wish that I have someone who is keen on knowing what I feel and what I head to...
