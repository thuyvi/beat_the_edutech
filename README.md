my edutech journey

<h1 style="font-size:20px;"><b> This path is TOUGH! </b></h1>

I am here, alone in Canada, pursuing a Master degree in Education, and trying to persuade people to hire me as an education technologist...
It's a pain-in-the-ass process.

Last week, I had to visit and moan with a Graduate School counsellor that I was so depressed and lost, and that I was thinking about leaving everything to go back to Vietnam.
We had a long talk. Now, I am writing to encourage myself as a process of therapy.<br> 
It is a cycle of depression. 

I know that I should keep moving on, believing the journey to define myself. 

I just wish that I have someone who is keen on knowing what I feel and what I head to...

<br>Being an research assistant is joyful. I love reading and collecting research material. However, working another job at the same time really drains out my energy. I didn't study coding much. I even didn't start with a website project to practice new skills in javascript and CSS. 
<br>Today, I have realized that I don't have enough data for my thesis. This is a huge problem. I couldn't focus to do anything except being disappointed about myself. 
<br>I will need to talk to my supervisor to figure out what I can do. 
<br>Pracing coding is nice. It helps me to be confident with technology. However, I need to graduate with a good research paper to go on with other plans.
<br>Am I too ambituous?
