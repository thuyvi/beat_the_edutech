my edutech journey

<h1 style="font-size:20px;"><b> This path is TOUGH! </b></h1>

I am here, alone in Canada, pursuing a Master degree in Education, and trying to persuade people to hire me as an education technologist...
It's a pain-in-the-ass process.

Last week, I have come to moan with a Graduate School counsellor that I was so depressed and lost, and that I should leave everything to go back to Vietnam.
She has helped me a lot. And now, I am writing to encourage myself. 
It is like a cycle of depression.
