my edutech journey

<h1 style="font-size:20px;"><b> This path is TOUGH! </b></h1>

I am here, alone in Canada, pursuing a Master degree in Education, and trying to persuade people to hire me as an education technologist...
It's a pain-in-the-ass process.

Last week, I have come to moan with a Graduate School counsellor that I was so depressed and lost, and that I should leave everything to go back to Vietnam.
She has helped me a lot. And now, I am writing to encourage myself. 
It is like a cycle of depression. 

I know that I should keep moving on, believing the journey to define myself. 

I just wish that I have someone who keen on knowing what I feel and what I head to...

One of the hardest tasks has been done... in just one day after the submition!! :D
I heard that some other papers were approval in months. This is such a surprise for me.
