Research Project Title: Cloud computing in school: Teachers’ feelings of comfort integrating Google Suite for Education in school contexts.
This quantitative research study is designed to expand knowledge regarding the relationship between secondary public-school teachers’ general technology integration levels and feelings of comfort using Google Suite for Education (GSFE or GSuite) in Nanaimo-Ladysmith public schools (SD68) in British Columbia, Canada. This study will use an anonymous paper-based survey instrument combining two subscales for a total of 56 items to examine teachers’ general levels of technology integration, examine the teachers’ levels of comfort and those same characteristics regarding teachers’ use of GSuite. This instrument is constructed from items used from the The Teacher Technology Integration Survey (Vannatta & Banister, 2009) and the Techsoup’s 2012 Global Cloud Computing Survey (Lim, Grönlund & Andersson, 2015). The study will use Pearson’s correlation coefficient to analyze potential relationships between the subscales by identifying bivariate or linear correlations between them. The strength of possible relationships will be used to suggest areas for future research and improvement for current integration practices and teachers’ feeling of comfort when using GSuite services for teaching and learning process. This research might also have wider implications for the integration of cloud computing services in education.
Education is increasingly more reliant on education technology (edtech) and the Internet and this demands classroom use of technologies (Magnussen, 2008). Thomas (2011) mentioned cloud computing (described as information technology services that are available to users anytime and anywhere with internet access) as a significant type of edtech. For example, Google Docs, the first application in GSuite, is a word processing application that allows students and teachers to view, work, and edit the same document simultaneously in real time—which powerfully enhances collaboration in learning and teaching (Spaeth & Black, 2012). Google Apps for Education (GAFE), which is now called GSuite or GSFE, is a cost-free suite of cloud-applications containing software like Google Docs that addresses various needs of teachers and students in a seamless integrated system. There has been an increasing uptake in GSuite as neoliberal economies in education across the US and Canada focus schools’ attention on “free” tools (Hengstler, 2017).
In 2014, Lim, Grönlund, and Andersson have investigated the beliefs and perceptions of Swedish school leaders toward integrating cloud computing in education. The results suggest that principals of primary and high schools in Sweden believe the main benefit of cloud computing in education is its ability to allow the teaching and learning process to occur anywhere if the learning materials, data and software can be shared and accessed via the Internet. Their biggest concerns are related to online security and privacy (Lim et al., 2014). The results argue a lack of shared views of beliefs among the school leaders and other stakeholders challenges the adoption of cloud computing in schools. Lim et al.’s (2014) study provides a firsthand information that can be related to further discussion and research on beliefs and perceptions of teachers, who have direct involvement in applying technology to evolve teaching practices in classes, and who are actually on the “front line of technology leadership” (Frerris & Roberts, 1993, p. 53).
In another study, Ng and Ho (2012) looked to discover school motivations and feelings of comfort regarding edtech reforms by examining the distributed leadership model that applied in Singapore’s government schools. Their study through observation and interviews of the school leaders and teachers at Greenville Elementary revealed that, among a multi-level model of distributed leadership, teachers with technology expertise could most impact changes in using technology in learning and teaching practices. The results suggested that the school’s feeling of comfort with edtech reforms was increased through a mixture of conventional workshops, on-the-job training, just-in-time “training”, and professional feedback that were led by teachers with edtech expertise in conjunction with support from senior managers (Ng & Ho, 2012).
Teachers do best when they possess confidence, understanding, and skills that come from adequate training and development to effectively access technology tools in school (Brand, 1997). General expectations to use technology combined with inadequate preparation may lead to teachers to experience negative feelings of comfort related to technology integration in daily instruction (Herro, 2015). In a study aimed at exploring why some educators embrace the use of digital game-play (DGP) in the classroom, Stieler-Hunt and Jones (2015) recommended that the attitude of the teachers should be emphasized and developed as a professional competency prior to addressing the practicalities of edtech integration.
While the above referenced studies address edtech integration in general, there is a paucity of research specifically addressing the integration of GSuite especially regarding Canadian schools. In 2015, Google reported that GSuite was used by more than 60 million students, teachers, and administrators around the world (Mohr, 2015). SD68 is one of many school districts across British Columbia provide K-12 staffs and students GSuite accounts to enhance the teaching and learning practices. Recent comments made by district administrators from around the province at the BC Educational Resource Acquisition Consortium workshop, “Due Diligence in the K-12 Education Context” (October 24, 2018; River Rock Casino, Vancouver, BC) indicate increasing pressure on BC public districts to adopt GSuite (J. Hengstler, personal communication, October 29, 2018).  Moreover, the year 2018 has witnessed a strong concern of parents toward the rising use of GSuite in classrooms across Canada (Desson, 2018; Malkin, 2018; Bresnahan, 2018). As the controversy intensifies over GSuite use regarding privacy and security, prompt and reliable research activities on the integration of GSuite as one of cloud computing services in education need to be done to generate more knowledge for educational stakeholders. The present research will contribute firsthand findings from self-reported surveys of teachers, who engage directly with GSuite in teaching and learning activities.
